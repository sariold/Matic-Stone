### How it works 🛠️

When you first visit the site, you can **mint a full deck of unique trading cards** — each one an NFT that you truly own and can trade on the blockchain. These cards store their metadata and AI-generated artwork securely and decentralized on the Ethereum mainnet and testnet.

On future visits, simply connect your **MetaMask** wallet 🔐 and your first 30 MaticStone tokens will load, initializing your unique deck and custom gameplay experience — think **Magic: The Gathering**, but on the blockchain!

Just like physical trading card games, you’re free to **trade your cards** on popular NFT marketplaces like **OpenSea** or **Rarible**. The minting, distribution, and token lifecycle is fully managed by Solidity smart contracts running on the blockchain — no centralized servers involved!
