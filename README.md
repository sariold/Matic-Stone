Cryptocurrencies continue to grow and thrive each day as new tokens are released into the market every single hour. The possibilities of utilizing decentralized storage are still being explored. Matic Stone sets out to combine an online JavaScript card game where the trading cards are unique mintable NFT's. 

- The value of allowing a user to mint a full deck of cards upon the initial site visit, creates unique trading cards that can be traded on the Blockchain. The decentralized storage of the Ethereum mainnet and testnet allow for these NFT's to store their corresponding metadata and unique AI generated artwork completely offsite.

- Each further visit to the site will allow the user to connect to their Web3 wallet, MetaMask, and our backend will retrieve their first 30 MaticStone tokens. This will allow for the initialization and instantiation of their unique playing cards and a custom game experience in a "Magic the Gathering" like fashion.

- Similar to trading card games in real life, the user is now free to trade their unique minted cards on any third-party NFT site, such as OpenSea or Rarible. Handling the minting, distribution, and testing of tokens will be entirely done in the Solidity smart contract programming language that will be hosted on the Blockchain once deployed.

- The project will have a fully decentralized database that is a public ledger to everyone. By utilizing ERC721 tokens, NFT's, the token's information and corresponding hash can be hosted on the blockchain layer itself. The unique trading card images and the card's information will be stored on an Interplanetary File System, decentralized online database for images and JSON metadata.

- ReactJS paired along with Bootstrap CSS will be used to design and construct the beautiful front end. The beauty of ReactJS is the ability to handle states within the front end as the game itself can be entirely static, the only information that changes is the unique player cards associated to one's wallet. This is done upon the initial MetaMask Web3 connection followed by the instantiation and initialization of the game.
